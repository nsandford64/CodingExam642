# CodingExam642
This sprint was a prototyping sprint, and the actual code created will not be used in a production environment. Because of this, the prototypes here do not have a testing suite or extensive documentation. Instead, we gathered our findings from the prototypes into the document *Prototype Findings.pdf*, which can be found in the main repository.

Additionally, there are a large number of libraries and pieces of software that must be installed for the development environment, so instructions on what we used to set ours up are in the *Developer Documentation* file in the *Documentation* folder.

Before we knew a prototype sprint didn't need as much documentation, we had already created some documentation, whcih can be found in the *Documentation* folder. However, because of the nature of the code, it is more for documenting what we actually prototyped for reference in future sprints. A *User Documentation* file details how the prototypes should display if the code is run, and a *Developer Documentation* file outlines how to set up the developer environment and the general structure of the prototype's code. 

Basically, we did include some things from a real release, but this is very much a prototype sprint, and those extra additions can be safely disregarded.
