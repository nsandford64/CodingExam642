# CodingExam642
This sprint was a prototyping sprint, and the actual code created will not be used in a production environment. Because of this, the prototypes here do not have a testing suite or extensive documentation. Instead, we gathered our findings from the prototypes into the document *Prototype Findings.pdf*, which can be found in the main repository.

We did create some more formal documentation for this prototype release in the *Documentation* folder, but because of the nature of the code, it is more for documenting what we actually prototyped for reference in future sprints. A *User Documentation* file details how the prototypes should display if the code is run, and a *Developer Documentation* file outlines how to set up the developer environment and the general structure of the prototype's code.
